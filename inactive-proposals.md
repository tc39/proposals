| [`from ... import`][fromimport] | Bradley Farias | Never presented; preliminary feedback about syntax cost not being worth the weight |

| [Unused Function Parameters][unused-params]                          | Gus Caplan                                                 | Rejected: the need to solve the problem does not outweigh the hazards
